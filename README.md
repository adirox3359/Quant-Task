The code is basically used to generate the volitality of a stock for the next 5 working days considering the data parameters such as RSI, MACD, Volume Spikes , EMA 20 and EMA 50 corssover.

The process begins with downloading the stock data using the yfinance API using which the indicators used are calculated directly. These include Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and its signal line, Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and its irregularity detection, and volume-based features such as volume change percentage.

Once the indicators are computed, future voltality prediction starts. This is calculated as the absolute percentage change in closing price over the next 5 days, which is known as target variabloe for prediction. Before feeding data into the model we kinda clean the data bu removing missing and infinite values and visualizes the relationships between features using a correlation matrix.

The cleaned dataset is split into training data which include 80% of the data and teh other for testing. A Random Forest Regressing model is trained to map the relationship between indicators and upcoming volatility. After training, the model is evaluated, its feature importance graph is plotted which gives the importance of each indicator towards the volitality calculation.

Finally, the trained model is saved using pickle to it can be reloaded later without retraining. The script concludes by outputting the most recent predicted volatility value for the given stock, helping users assess potential upcoming movement intensity based on past indicator patterns. The output number is basically the percentage of expected volitality in the next 5 days.

The code also includes a feature where we provide data till 5 days before which can be used to measure the accuracy of the output recieved.
