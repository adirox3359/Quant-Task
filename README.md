This project uses historical stock data and technical indicators to predict short-term stock volatility â€” specifically, the percentage price change expected over the next 5 days. Built in Python and designed for Google Colab, the script pulls stock data using the yahoo finance API and calculates indicators like RSI, MACD, EMA, and volume-based features. After cleaning the data, we define future volatility as our target and explore relationships between features using a correlation matrix. A Random Forest Regressor is then trained to map technical patterns to upcoming volatility. The model is saved using pickle for reuse, and it outputs a volatility prediction based on the latest available data.
